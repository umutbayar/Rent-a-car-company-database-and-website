Overview
The AYSAN Car Rentals database system is designed to track and manage car rentals, customer orders, payments, and related activities for the AYSAN company. The system provides an interface for both customers and administrators to interact with the rental platform, ensuring smooth processing of orders, payments, and vehicle availability.
